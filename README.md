# Predict whether income exceeds $50k/yr using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Associated with Coventry University

I use the US census data from the UCI machine learning repository for this project. To categorize whether a person earns more than $50,000 or less than $50,000, machine learning approaches such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees are employed. Precision, Recall, and F1 score were utilized as assessment measures because this is a classification problem.
